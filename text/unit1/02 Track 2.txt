 Unit 1, task 3. Primary School Teacher. We've got a new programme with 3D graphics to encourage young children to tell stories. We tried it out last term, and now we use it regularly. There's a mat in front of the monitor like a carpet. There are pressure pads under the mat. When the children stand on them, they can move about inside the pictures on the screen. If they stand on the right, they can move to the right and so on. The good thing is that it works better if there are more children on the mat. This encourages them to work together. What I like about this programme is that if you ask the children what they've been doing, they don't say we've been working with the computer. They say we've been telling stories. The computer doesn't get in the way of learning. It's just a tool. We don't get that reaction when we sit them down at a keyboard.
