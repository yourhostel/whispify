 Open University student. I've had a computer for about... Oh, three years now. I'm an all-you student doing a degree in mathematics. I work full-time, so I study at home in the evenings and at weekends. Some Saturdays, there are tutorials I can attend and town, but mostly I work alone. I use the computer to write my assignments. I also use the internet to email my tutor if I have any problems with the coursework. There's a help group too on the web, made up of other students doing my course, not just here in the UK, but around the world. We can chat about assignments and help each other out if we're in difficulty.
