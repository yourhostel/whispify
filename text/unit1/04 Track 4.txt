 Louise, age 6 Well, I make cards for my friends. I made one for Mary's birthday last week. I use words and you go into clip art. Then these things come up on the screen and you can click on any one, like animals and two people with a heart, and a star and a hat. I've got CD-Rums. I like Splat the cat and pet three. You click on go to the adoption centre. Then you go to pick a pet and you can choose what you want, a cat or a dog and you can give it a name and feed it. The one I'm going to adopt is a cat and you've got to give your cat a name. But first I'll take its picture. Then I'll save it.
