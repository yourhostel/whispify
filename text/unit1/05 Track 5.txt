 Artist. I paint mainly figures in imaginary interiors. They represent myths. I work in acrylics, although I also make woodcuts. I keep photographs of most of what I've done. Apart from the work I've destroyed, the ones I didn't like, I've scanned in about a third of these photographs around 100 paintings to make a CD. I've organised the paintings into themes and added a soundtrack so that each group of paintings is accompanied by music. I'll send the CD to dealers. In the past, it would have been slides. I'm also going to start my own website to try to sell directly. The difficult thing is trying to get people to visit your site.
