1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Унижается 7, в речи 40.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,600
Okay, let's have a quick look at the Gantt chart.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,200
What's our schedule?

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,600
Well, the systems analysts are finishing their tasks at the end of week 3.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,199
So your team is scheduled to start coding in week 4.

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:29,600
Then the second milestone, being ready for alpha testing, is due in week 9.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:34,000
So we have five weeks to do the coding.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,800
Yep, that's right.

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,800
And then the alpha testing is due to finish at the end of week 10.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,200
So your schedule to deal with the feedback from that in week 11.

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,400
And we have two weeks to do that.

12
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:58,400
And then according to the chart, we start again in week 16 after the alpha testing.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,000
Hmm, we only have a week after the beta testing.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
That doesn't sound very long.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're right, that's rather short.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,200
I think there's a mistake.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,599
The beta testing should only last two weeks, not three.

18
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:21,200
So you should have two weeks to deal with the feedback.

19
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
I'll change the chart.

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,400
Two weeks for beta testing.

21
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,800
And two weeks after that, for you to do the debugging.

22
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Okay, that's better.

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,000
Thanks very much.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,200
No, that's okay.

25
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,600
We should still be able to finish the project before week 18.
