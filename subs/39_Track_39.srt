1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,299
Unit 7, recording 39.

2
00:00:04,299 --> 00:00:08,339
Now, let's look at the IF statements.

3
00:00:08,339 --> 00:00:09,939
See the four of them here?

4
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:11,040
Yep.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,140
Now, the first one looks at key underscore press.

6
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,820
IF key underscore press is A,

7
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,359
then G underscore move becomes one.

8
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,699
In other words, pressing A on the mobile phone

9
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:36,939
means that G underscore move takes the value of one.

10
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:40,280
That's correct.

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,299
And later in the program, we'll see that if G underscore move is one,

12
00:00:46,299 --> 00:00:49,219
the robot moves forwards a step.

13
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:50,820
I see.

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,500
So, looking at the next line,

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,739
if you press F on the phone,

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:01:02,100
G underscore move becomes two,

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,140
and the robot moves forwards two steps.

18
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:10,040
Well, the first bit's right, yes.

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,439
G underscore move becomes two,

20
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:20,540
but two actually makes the robot move back a step.

21
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,180
Hmm.

22
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,780
I see.

23
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,900
So, for the next one,

24
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,280
if you press S,

25
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:36,540
I can see that G underscore turn becomes one.

26
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,879
But does that make the robot turn right or left?

27
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,980
It turns left.

28
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,719
So pressing D makes it turn right.

29
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:50,719
That's correct.
