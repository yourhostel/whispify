1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Unit 7, recording 38.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now to begin with, there are two main variables called G-Under score Move and G-Under score Turn.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The first one, G-Under score Move, tells the robot which way to go, back, forward or stay still.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
If G-Under score Move is zero, the robot doesn't move.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Okay.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The second variable, G-Under score Turn, tells it to turn left, turn right or not to turn.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I see. So if G-Under score Turn is zero, it doesn't turn.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
That's right.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now, look at the first line of the code here.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It sets G-Under score Move and G-Under score Turn to zero.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Telling it not to move and not to turn.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
That's right.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I see. And the next line?

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
See this variable here? Key underscore Press.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
This has the value of the key pressed on the phone.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So, if you press A on the phone, for example, key underscore Press has the value A.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And...

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If I press the X key on the phone, key underscore Press takes the value X.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Yep. You've got it.
